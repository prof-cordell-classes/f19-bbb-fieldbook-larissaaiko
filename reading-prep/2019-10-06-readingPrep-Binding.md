# Reading Prep: WEEK NAME

## Questions or Observations

1. Quotes I enjoyed and/or caught my attention: 

	"The matter of content was, it must be confessed, a less important consideration." This one caught my attention because in my reflection for last week I argued for the exact opposite of this. That the content should be considered more than the presentation. ***Update:*** I was very confused because I thought I was reading a review of Baxter's Procrustes, not actually Baxter's Procrustes. It makes sense now that this quote was written in this book, since BP is Chesnutt's mockery of the Rowfant Club. Wow. He was really out there calling everyone shallow after being rejected admission into the club due to the "One Drop Rule". **Bold.** I like it. 

	 " Religion was mostly superstition, science for the most part sciolism, popular education merely a means of forcing the stupid and repressing the bright, so that all the youth of the rising generation might conform to the same dull, dead level of democratic mediocrity. Life would soon become so monotonously uniform and so uniformly monotonous as to be scarce worth the living." I love how this idea was expressed. 
	 
	 "To the true collector, a book is a work of art, of which the contents are no more important than the words of an opera."
	 
	 I loved this story. 
	 
	In an age where a book's content is infinite, ever existing, and permanent (thank you internet), do we tend to place more emphasis on the physical aspects of a work rather than its content? If you think about it, there are only a few copies of the Gutenberg Bible that Gutenberg actually printed. You will probably never touch an original Gutenberg Bible in your life, but you can read it online whenever you want.

2. In response to "How to Design an Awarded Letterpress Printed Book" and FIAPO.

	Does applying unconventional and abnormal methods/characteristics/concepts of a "normal" object make it artistic? Does the rarity of it add value to it? 
	
	Layflat binding reminds me of the board books that they have for kids.
	
3. I wonder what Zachary Petit's article, “Letterpress Goes for a Hike: The Printed Walk” has to do with binding? I thought the article was interesting and Lindsay's kickstarter project was very creating but I don't think it related much to binding. The word "binding" isn't even mentioned once in the entire article. I wonder if she ever got Lyme disease. Overall, interesting article to read but failed to understand the relevance of it to this week's topic of "binding".
