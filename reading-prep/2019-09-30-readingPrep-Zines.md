# Reading Prep: Zines

#### LARISSA MORIKAWA

## Questions or Observations

1. I expected zines to be short and small after first reading Pagan Kennedy's description of a zine and how it is perceived by most of the "professional writing world": not serious, amateur, handmade,etc. I was surprised to see that there was a fair amount of writing in the zine. Moreover, it was very well written and thought out. In her book, Pangan Kennedy, talks about how she created a different persona and adopted a new writing style in order to land a job. If writing is a form of art and creative expression, why is it that, even in the writing world, true creativity and intimacy is sometimes desregarded? Why are zines considered "amateuristic" or "unofficial"?
2. "Moreover, purchasing zines demonstrates respect for the value of the zinester's work" - Zine Librarian's Code of Ethics. If zines were to be mass produced and shown to have the potential of making a lot of profit, will it's credibility increase? Will people start taking it "more seriously"? 
3. Would you consider erasure poetry writing? or more so an artform? Would it be both? Or would it depend on if its only blacked out as opposed to when visual elements are added such as collages?
