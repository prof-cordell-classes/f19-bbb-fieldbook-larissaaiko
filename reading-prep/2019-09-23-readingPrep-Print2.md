## Questions or Observations

1.	Are the aesthetics of a certain font considered aesthetic because they follow a basic set of rules that are culturally accepted? Or are they regarded based on their true “beauty”/”aesthetics” re. Reverse Stress Typefaces
		a.	Maelstromi.	“I have a soft spot for reverse-stress typefaces-fonts that are thickest on the strokes that are typically thin, and vice-versa. This is a strange and uncomfortable genre of typeface, which is why it’s so exciting to see it tacked by one of the best typeface designers practicing.” – Kris Sowesbyii.	Is it strange and uncomfortable because the strokes don’t match what it was developed to be historically? Or is it truly just a design that the human eye is displeased with?2.	If you were to design an eponymous typeface for Boston, what would you draw your inspirations from? a.	Pablo Medina i.	Took pictures of letterforms around Bushwick. ii.	The typeface is heavily influenced by the Latino community. 

	a.“The bulky ‘Ultra’ style brings to mind graf ‘throw-up letters’, the ‘drop shade’ affect is reminiscent of the many sign-painted and aluminum letter forms in the Latino community."
		
	b.	Boston
	
		i.	Heavy historical influence
	- Colonial era + Industrial Revolution
	- The typeface would most likely reminisce elegantly flourished letter with curves. Somewhat cursive-like? 
	- Have European influence but with some American industrial age typeface details. 
	- Block letters, taller, bold, heavy emphasis on uppercase letters. 
	- Heavy, tall, block letters, with subtle flourishes, a bit slanted. 
	- Maybe visible brush strokes (?)      3.	Can a typeface have its own innate “attitude” or “personality”? Or do those “attitudes” come about from  how the typeface or brand is marketed? 

	a. “The Hermes iteration of the Memphis typeface has “Fuck You” kerning, designed to evoke the privileges, status and authority of “Fuck You” wealth. 
	
	- Does that attitude exist innately in the typeface and the design of the typeface? Or does it come from the fact that we know that Hermes is such an exclusive and expensive brand? 
	- Does our prior knowledge play into our perception of a brand?
		- 	The brand Anthropologie also has a similar font to Hermes, but it is not as expensive. 
		-  Arguable whether or not there is a “Fuck You” attitude. 
		-  Nowadays, there are a lot of modern memes and parodies that use cute font to post dark humor and profanities.
