# Reading Prep: BOOK ALTERITIES

#### LARISSA MORIKAWA

## Questions or Observations

1. "A novel with no capital letters, or with different letter types, or with chemical formulae interspersed here and there etc., is still a novel, that is to say, a boring book pretending to be such." At first, I was going to argue the fact that the author of this text was being a bit too overdramatic and harsh with his statements. Seeing how he calls a novel "boring" irked me in the wrong way. But the more I read this quote, the more I came to understand where he was coming from. For Carrion, a book is nothing much but a thing, a container of words; it's just a physical thing. He sees the content, story, message, poem, etc itself as separate from the book. So when a book contains a "novel" it's quite boring because it restricted by the rules of grammar and spacing for the story to be conveyed properly. Poems, Carrion argues, are not restricted by as many rules that usually come with transcribing words and so there are more liberties as to what the book looks like and/or is. I could however, argue that poems also have rules to follow and sometimes can be more restricted as to how it is transcribed into text. But I shall explore that idea further in the reflection.
		
2. Is there a way to make books that are completely universal? I feel like Bok tries to do this by taking into account time and permanency. He tackles the test of time by putting his book into an almost indestructable bacteria that can survive almost any extreme events. With this bacteria, he gave his book the power to be shared across time. People way in the future could, theoretically, get their hands on the book if they wanted to because it will probably be "available then". But what about how language and time are related. Schuster asks, "How can poems and genomes be ways of transmitting that 'you' for ten thousand years?" 
3. Is it acceptable to alter holy texts and other texts that are valued by certain groups? What if you don't value it? What if you do, and you see the potential of "adding" to it?
