# Reading Prep: E-LIT II

#### LARISSA MORIKAWA

## Questions or Observations

1. In the article about *First Screening*, the following is written: "... how the destiny of digital writing usually **remains the responsibility of the digital writers themselves**. As a group and individually." But then it is followed by: "This project illustrates that **work can indeed survive the obsolescence of technologies if others are still interested in the work** and the artist has provided what is required to implement the work using later technologies." 

Wouldn't this then mean that the readers are the actual people who are responsible for the destiny of digital writing? 

2. E-lit such as First Screenings and Agrippa are considered special because there is a possibility for them to seize to exist at any moment. Their fleeting existence intrigues scholars. I wonder if the opposite would be as intriguing. An e-lit that is permanent. For example something that once you open it, it permanently attaches to your harddrive, you can never get rid of it. Somehting resembling a virus but a rather harmless one that represents the concept of permanency. 

3. Chosen E-Lit: Golpe de Gracia by Jaime Alejandro Rodriguez. This is an interactive e-lit that was made in Bogota, Colombia uses various communicative morphologies (animation, game, image, music, sound, voices, text), to tell the story of a man who goes through an experience near death, after having been the victim of an assault. I was curious about this work so I read the author's note and he mentioned how this story was supposed to be a metaphor for the way that we as a society are constantly challenged with the onslaught of new paradigms and are constantly experiencing the "death" of "old" ways. This reminded me of one of our earliest discussions where we discussed "digital fatigue" and the possibility of "normalization fatigue". As time goes by, there is no denying that "old" ways tend to disappear as "new", more convenient ways emerge. However, it is worth noting that our society does tend to go back to some "old" ways as discussed in class.
