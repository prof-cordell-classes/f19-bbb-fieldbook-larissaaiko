# Reading Prep: 3D PRINTING

## Questions or Observations

1. "The book is art, but it pushes the limits of existing technologies" When I was reading this article I felt like it was more like existing technologies are pushing the limits of books. There are so many efforts to try to make books in a new way or redefine what a book and we are constantly testing how far the we can go before the product stops being a book. 
2. One of my favorite inventions was the Mic Jammer. First, I liked how it sounded like a play on words of Mick Jagger, but wasn't sure if that was on purpose or not. Second, I liked the idea of it and the innovation behind it. I hope they can develop this into a more practical model for people's everyday use. For example, partnering up with tech companies to incorporate this technology into cellphones or computers. 
3. "Its [object's] transformations - of state, form, material, location, environment - especially bring to light the ways all aterial objects function across time, space, and context." This made me think about our class discussions and presentations about what a book is. I think our discussions go to show that as much as humans evolve over time, objects and the components that make up those objects do too. This is why it would be hard to define any object. This ties back to my earlier observation from Susan Garfinkel's article on the 3D printed book, where with the development of new technology, we see these constantly pushing the limits of books. This concept can be applied to any object. One obvious one would be a phone. Our definition and description of a phone has changed throughout time. And because of new technologies, software and programs, it's getting harder to say what is or is not specifically a phone. ie. would an iPad be a phone? Screened fridges considered a phone? (new ones have wifi connection and can video chat!)
