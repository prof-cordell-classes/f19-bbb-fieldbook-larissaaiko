## Questions or Observations

1. "In this chapter, we describe some ways to think productively about materiality by demonstrating how material interventions trouble theoretical work (and vice versa)" When trying to define an object such as a book, what should we emphasize more? The matieral or the "essence". Does the definition of a book come from the "essence or its physical form?
2. "Among the most interesting discoveries we have encountered in our engagements with cultural institutions is a heightened sensitivity to how preparing an object for display can be a more important locus of epistemic activity than the exhibited object itself." Are/Should objects be defined by it's physical and abstract value or is it usually defined by the experience, relationship and interaction it has with the humans that ultimately define them?
3. Where and how do we place the limit as to how an object is defined? In this world, definitions are given to objects by humans. We label different things to bring order and organization into our everyday lives. It also allows for easier communication. So is it worth discussing the definition of something to such an extent when definitions themselves are rather subjective.
